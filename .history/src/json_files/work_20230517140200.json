However, the additional complexity arose in the form of encrypting each detail of certificates before storing them on IPFS. By employing advanced cryptography techniques, we successfully achieved secure and private storage of sensitive information, providing users with peace of mind regarding the confidentiality of their data."

However, the additional complexity arose in the form of encrypting each detail of certificates before storing them on IPFS. By employing advanced cryptography techniques, we successfully achieved secure and private storage of sensitive information, providing users with peace of mind regarding the confidentiality of their data."

To overcome this obstacle, we implemented a solution known as gasless transactions. This approach allows users to interact with the application seamlessly, similar to a web2 application, without requiring a web3 wallet or gas fees.

To address this challenge, we implemented a decentralized storage system using IPFS (InterPlanetary File System). However, the additional complexity arose in the form of encrypting each detail of certificates before storing them on IPFS. By employing advanced cryptography techniques, we successfully achieved secure and private storage of sensitive information, providing users with peace of mind regarding the confidentiality of their data."
